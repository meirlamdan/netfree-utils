- replace blocked youtube iframes with a placeholder with the video thumbnail
- Floating popup showing blocked URLs on the current tab (this feature is based on the great idea and implementation in [NetFree Helper](https://github.com/yossef7525/netfree-helper) by [yossef7525](https://github.com/yossef7525))
- More features coming in the future
